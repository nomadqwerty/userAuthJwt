    title: "decent phone with the typical gotchas",
    body: "Switched from an iphone 8 plus to the S23 (vanilla) due to the pricing vs iphone 14($799). Got this at $599 on prime day. Amazon's competitor also had a sale earlier in the year. It is new, and when i registered with samsung said the warranty is good for a year. That means that this is really a new phone. It is hard to tell these days which vendor is selling new, and which ones are used (climate pledge friendly...renewed :) .It is impossible to search for NEW . That means that it is the US version phone (one sim slot, and one esim). I have not verified esim.  The audio through the bose soundlink is a little different from the apple sound. I am tinkering with the synthesizer(hard to find online examples). I cleared up the echo noises, but still need to work on the bass. There is about a 30gb memory hogged up by samsung setup and bloatware. Still having glitches with whatsapp history through the smartswitch cable transfer.  The camera is better than the iphone 8plus, but not sure about it compared to more up to date phones. at 30 x and a distance of 8 feet away, the image is less detailed than if you are 3 feet away with normal zoom 1x. But at $599, it is great. I will have to learn this camera system better. Minor video games, surfing will work for a day and a half(same as iphone 8 plus) playing candy crush saga, scrabble, solitaire. With a 25watt charger, it takes about 45 minutes to charge from 45% to full charge. Wireless charging is slow with the phone case and wireless charger. 25 watt plugin and 10 wireless charger). Fingerprint works so so (reset it when i put on a new screensaver ) and have not tried the facial recognition. The touch times out after 5 attempts. setup the index finger and thumb for both hands. I bet if I go into the Samsung store, an app guru can clear up most of the little gotchas.",

    title: "Sleek and works well.",
    body: "Bought this for my mother to use as she was overdue for an upgrade. I am personally an iOS user.  Aesthetic-- The design of this phone is very sleek and lightweight. I particularly like that its design is a little less wide with consideration to holding the phone better, especially if you have smaller hands like we do.  Camera-- Immaculate camera quality for the price. I think I'm jealous. There's great contrast and saturation to colors, and it gives life to the photos taken. There's so much more detail as well. Not a fan of using it for selfies for that same reason though haha!  As for software, I think it was fairly simple to setup and relatively straightforward. Samsung has come a long way since the very first Galaxy S I used prior to switching, and this is one of their best designs on my opinion.",

    title: "Great Phone. Recommended.",
    body: "This is a pretty pricy phone. But so far so food seems worth it... hoping it will serve me for some years... it's on the smaller and lighter side so please keep that in mind also the plus version is a bit larger n comes with some more upgraded specs of that matters to you...  I like the smaller size personally and the customization with GoodLock is awesome. Glad I went with this over the iphone.",

    title: "Great camera, not so great battery",
    body: "One of the reasons I upgraded from my Galaxy S10 was because the battery was no longer holding a charge more than a few hours, which was expected after 2.5 years of use.  However, the S23 is down to 20% battery after only 10 hours including few phone calls but a couple episodes of a series, plus browsing and texting, almost no socials.  The camera is a agreat improvement although I love the S10's. This camera takes very good portraits and is 8K capable although those videos are quite heavy and demand a lot from apps like CapCut, also take a lot of space.",

    title: "No more SD card!",
    body: 'Wow am I disappointed. I was "upgrading " from a Samsung S20 to the S23. The listing from the Samsung store on Amazon is weak. A few key points are left out or hidden. First is the fact that Samsung decided to eliminate the SD card slot to force people to buy a higher capacity phone. I had a 128g and this is a 128g so its a step backwards. I had 12g memory, this has 8g. The S23 screen is slightly smaller and a slightly smaller battery. $700 for a slightly better camera / processor? It\'s getting returned.',

    title: "blue tooth connectivity not as strong",
    body: "My old Galaxy S6 Active had a longer blue tooth connectivity range on both my Bose Mini and my Shokz headphones, than this new S23. Keeps cutting out, even when using the app. Annoying. Camera is great. Battery life should be good since it is brand new. Easy set up and transfer. Using a screen saver, the fingerprint scanner is intermittent. Need to moisten finger to get it to work.",

    title: "Cheaper than T-Mobile and unlocked",
    body: "Not much to say other than the item arrived quickly and was brand new. We wanted to pay cash for the phone but T-Mobile, as most phone carriers do now, wanted to charge a connection or setup fee. What a ripoff! So, bought the device here and simply put the SIM card in and voila! Worked perfectly.",

This phone also does not support international SIMs (to try and force you to pay for international roaming). So, if you are a frequent international traveler do not buy a cell phone from Samsung.",

    title: "I bought the phone",
    body: "Through spectrum but I had an apple.  My compliant wtih the apple phone is I never could hear well on it and others couldn't hear me well. No matter what I did. I never could hear my son on his phone either so I believed it to be an apple issue not a me issue. Apple phones for some reason sound so soft to me.  So I switched back to the samsung galaxy. The phone is not my favouirte. Half the time it won't read my fingerprint. The pictures are OK but not as good quality as I excepted for a new phone. Limited features. And as it won't read my fingerprint very often I don't have to touch the xxx thing and like this morning it placed an order for me. apparently I can't remove my information without doing an entire factory reset.  I hate you have to go to your contacts for phone number then an app for voicemail. I was told it had voice to text but my phone always says its unavailable. I can't use this bixby thing correctly and it makes it hard I won't set up to my blue tooth in my car so its useless. Picture taking is omg annoying. to screen shot I have to use two buttons on the same side at the same time. The entire phone is clumsy. I do not like it. I wasn't allowed to return it so now I'm stuck with this heap of crap until I decided to eat the cost and buy a different phone.  Oh they have the volume control on the side so when you hold your phone in your hand it turns it up and down. I have resorted to having it on speaker phone all the time because I also hang up on everyone using it. I had ZERO issues like this with my other phones.  I just don't like it. So not happy with it.",

    title: "Great upgrade",
    body: "Previously has the S10e for the longest time and needed an upgrade. I have small hands so the Ultra and Plus phones are always too big but the Regular is perfect.  Pros: Battery life is amazing, I can go almost 2 days without a charge unless I use it continually for 8 hours. Very sleek design with vibrant display and camera quality is out of this world (which is what I originally bought this for). Thank god they got rid of the Bixby function in the S20s series.  Cons: None so far, have had the phone for a month with screen protector and case. Will update if any occur.",
